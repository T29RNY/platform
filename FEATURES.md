# In or Out — Feature Tracker
*Last updated: May 28 2026 (session 54 — booking push-on-confirm + **LEAGUE MODE Phase 5 Cycles 5.1 + 5.2 + 5.3** shipped + competitive testbed)*

---

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 5 CYCLE 5.3 SHIPPED (session 54, 2026-05-28)

Competition fixtures on the player screen. New `CompetitionFixturesCard.jsx`
rendered in PlayerView's my-view directly below the standings card: a collapsible
list grouped UPCOMING (scheduled) then RESULTS (most-recent-first), each row showing
opponent (`vs`/`@`), week/round + date (+ kickoff for upcoming), score, and a
W/D/L result chip (green/grey/red) from the player's team perspective.

- **New RPC `get_player_competition_fixtures(p_token, p_filter)`** (mig 155) —
  SECURITY DEFINER, search_path locked, anon+authenticated. Token → player → active
  competitions → that team's fixtures. `p_filter` ∈ upcoming/past/all (forgiving
  fallback to all). Per-row player perspective (is_home, opponent_name, my_score,
  result). Walkover/forfeit reported as status truthfully (no phantom 3-0 — standings
  owns that). Designed once for: this card + Phase 4 reception + Phase 6 HQ (RPCS.md).
- **Self-gating**: casual token → `fixtures: []` → card renders `null`; casual flow
  untouched. Rows not yet tappable — Cycle 5.4 wires inline fixture detail.
- **Verified**: rollback-transaction pre-flight (Tarny 2W+1 upcoming, casual []),
  applied live + schema reload, live re-check (Tarny 3 / casual 0), rpc-security ✓,
  hygiene ✓, build ✓, raw RPC name once in supabase.js. On-device confirm operator-owed.

---

## PITCH BOOKING — backend + casual UI complete (session 52, 2026-05-28)

B2C casual pitch booking + the unified occupancy guard. Full plan, stage table,
and commit hashes in **PITCH_BOOKING_HANDOFF.md**. Built this session:

- **Occupancy guard** (`pitch_occupancy`, partial GiST EXCLUDE) — a casual booking
  and a competitive fixture can never double-book the same pitch+time; maintenance
  blocks both. Priority: maintenance > fixture > block > ad-hoc.
- **Fixtures + maintenance** auto-project into occupancy via triggers; the venue
  fixture-write RPCs auto-yield un-confirmed bookings and gate on confirmed clashes.
- **Booking lifecycle** — request → confirm/decline, walk-in create, cancel (single +
  series), all through the guard + audit + realtime on both channels.
- **Casual UI** — Match Settings "Book a Pitch": venue discovery, one-off + weekly
  block, length picker, confirm w/ cancellation policy, live Requested→Confirmed
  badge + cancel.
- **demo_venue** enabled for testing (reversible).

**Stage 6 venue UI — done (session 53, mig 150 + commits `df7764f`/`7503d11`/`6378c40`):**
venue dashboard Bookings surface — requests inbox (block series grouped), colour-coded
resource-timeline calendar (desktop) / single-pitch agenda (mobile), tap-empty walk-in,
tap-block detail with cancel/confirm/decline, settings (bookings toggle + cancellation
policy + per-pitch booking-windows editor), `venue_live` subscriber refetching occupancy
on the 5 booking reasons. Hardening pass (`202d16a`): casual bookings list now refreshes
live on venue broadcasts; BookPitchModal date off-by-one (toISOString/UTC) fixed.

**Stage 7 — done (session 53, migs 151–152 + commits `b398b05`/`9dd953e`/`ca4a174`/`aca0cd4`):**
renewal right-of-first-refusal (a series ending ≤21d auto-holds the next block for the team
via `create_renewal_holds` cron at 09:00 UK; team "Keep slot" → `confirm_renewal` flips
holds→requested for venue re-approval; unconfirmed holds auto-expire via `expire_renewal_holds`
after a 7-day grace) + push to team admins for renewal-held/expired and for fixture-superseded
bookings (`supersededPushJob`, polls `superseded_at`). All gated (ephemeral-verify +
rpc-security-sweep). **Booking initiative complete.**

**Remaining:** deferred push-on-confirm; transactional email (Phase 9). **Payment OFF but
schema-wired.** **Operator owes** a real-squad + real-device test of the casual + venue flows
(auth-dependent) incl. the three booking pushes (GO_LIVE §6).

---

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 5 CYCLE 5.2 SHIPPED (session 54, 2026-05-28)

Competition standings on the player screen. New `CompetitionStandingsCard.jsx`
rendered in PlayerView's my-view (below MySquads): a collapsible league table
(Pos/Team/P/W/D/L/GF/GA/GD/Pts) with the player's own team highlighted gold.

- **Pure client UI** — reuses the existing `get_league_standings_for_player` RPC +
  `getLeagueStandingsForPlayer` wrapper (migs 087/104). No server/migration/wrapper change.
- **Self-gating**: a casual token returns no competitions → card renders `null`, so the
  casual flow is untouched (no `is_competitive` prop needed). Form column omitted (not in
  the RPC shape — later enhancement, would need a server change).
- **Verified in-browser** against the live competitive testbed: Competitive FC top on 6pts,
  own row highlighted, columns correct, clears the fixed nav; casual token shows no card
  (DOM-checked). Build + hygiene clean. Naming `Competition*` to avoid the StatsView
  `PlayerLeagueTable` clash. On-device confirm operator-owed (hard-rule #13).
- Demo competitive testbed (mig 154): **Competitive FC** (Tarny team admin) + 3 opponents
  in a Demo Competitive League; admin link `/admin/democomp_fc_admin_token`; remove via
  `154_..._down.sql` (rollback-verified safe).

---

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 5 CYCLE 5.1 SHIPPED (session 54, 2026-05-28)

First Phase 5 cycle — competitive surfaces *inside* `apps/inorout`, additive +
render-gated (casual flow untouched). Cycle 5.1 is the foundation: detect which
squads are competitive + a `LEAGUE` pill on MySquads.

- **mig 153** — `player_get_teams_by_token` (mig 072) extended with an
  `is_competitive boolean` (squad has an ACTIVE registration in a `league`-type
  competition). Return-type change → DROP+CREATE; search_path aligned to
  `public,pg_temp`; grants unchanged (anon+authenticated). No new RPC, no N+1, no
  wrapper change (field flows through `getPlayerTeamsByToken`).
- **MySquads.jsx** — `LEAGUE` pill (purple token) on every competitive squad
  (current + other active rows), beside the existing CURRENT/ADMIN pills via a flex
  wrapper. Casual squads unchanged.
- **Verified:** ephemeral rollback proof (competitive→true, casual→false, 0 rows
  persisted); rpc-security-sweep (secdef/search_path/overload=1/grants); RPC-ref +
  hygiene clean on changed files; casual-regression in-browser against the real
  Finbars token (no LEAGUE pill on casual squads; CURRENT/ADMIN intact; no
  regression). **On-device visual confirm operator-owed** (hard-rule #13, MySquads
  in PWA scope).
- **Locked for later cycles (from this session's discussion):** league availability
  is two-stage (players signal "who's in" → admin confirms the lineup → submitted to
  the league); players + admin override; reuse the familiar in/out tile look; **no
  Team A/B split for league** (you play an external opponent — the casual Group
  Balancer never runs for a league fixture). Governs cycles 5.5/5.6.
- Decisions/full plan: `~/.claude/plans/continuing-phase-3-of-steady-falcon.md`.

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 3 COMPLETE (session 51, 2026-05-27)

All six Phase 3 cycles shipped + Vercel deployment. The ref view is
now feature-complete and live: a referee can open the link on their
phone at the pitch, see both squads, hold Start, log goals / cards /
subs / period changes, work offline if signal drops, confirm full
time, and see a read-only post-match summary. Venue admins can
override results via the venue dashboard's RPC (UI to follow).

**What shipped in session 51 (this session):**
- **Cycle 3.3 — LiveMatch screen (commit `da89740`)**. Sticky clock+score
  bar, two-team player rows with ⚽/🟨/🟥/↕️ tap targets, long-press
  goal → own goal, second yellow auto-prompts red, sub picker modal,
  half-time / start-2H / full-time period actions, 30s undo toast
  wired to `ref_undo_event`, full-time confirm dialog. Optimistic UI
  with revert-on-error throughout.
- **Cycle 3.4 — Offline event queue (commit `7ce2bac`)**. Every event
  tap persisted to IndexedDB BEFORE the RPC call. Drain loop replays
  pending rows on mount / `online` event / manual Retry. Idempotent
  by client_event_id (mig 120 ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING) so duplicate
  replays are server-side no-ops. Sticky amber "Offline · N queued"
  / green "Syncing · N pending" banner. beforeunload guard on
  pending-count > 0. No service worker (deliberate — avoids the
  session-50 SW failure family entirely).
- **Cycle 3.5 — Score materialisation + standings cascade (verified, no commit)**.
  End-to-end ephemeral fixture via Supabase MCP: ran ref_start →
  9 events → ref_confirm_full_time → asserted score 3-1 / completed
  / standings W=1 GF=3 GA=1 PTS=3 / undone-goal correctly excluded /
  own-goal correctly credited to opposite team. Discovered: no
  cascade trigger exists — standings are computed on-read by
  `get_league_standings_for_player` (mig 087/104), so the cycle
  shipped nothing because no code needed adding. Verified clean.
- **Cycle 3.6 — Post-match summary + venue result override (commit `563201b`)**.
  - New mig 127: `venue_update_fixture_result(venue_token, fixture_id, home, away, reason)` —
    SECURITY DEFINER, token-gated via `resolve_venue_caller`, requires
    fixtures in `status='completed'`, non-empty reason, audit-logs
    previous + new scores + reason, broadcasts `result_corrected` to
    both teams + venue + league.
  - **Side-effect fix in mig 127**: `notify_venue_change` had silently
    regressed in mig 121 (whitelist shrank 26 reasons → 3, every
    Phase 2 RPC calling it has been logging WARNINGs for the past
    week). Restored full Phase 2 list + added new Phase 3 reasons
    while rewriting the function body. Plus `notify_league_change`
    gained `fixture_result_corrected`.
  - New `apps/ref/src/views/PostMatch.jsx`: read-only summary with
    scorers, cards, subs, "Share result" button (copies plain-text
    summary to clipboard). Footnote: "Need a correction? Ask the
    venue admin." App.jsx routes status='completed' → PostMatch.
  - Verified end-to-end against ephemeral fixture: bad inputs
    rejected with correct error codes, 1-1 → 2-3 override worked,
    standings reflect override, second override (0-0) worked, audit
    rows + metadata correct. Zero leak.

**Vercel deployment for apps/ref**:
- New Vercel project `platform-ref` (id `prj_akoL30MbOSlO7DSrT7f1OYagWbE0`)
  linked to this monorepo's main branch, root directory `apps/ref`.
- Env vars set: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  (production + development; preview skipped due to a CLI bug with
  `--yes` for "all preview branches" — can add later when needed).
- Live at `https://platform-ref.vercel.app` and the auto-generated
  branch aliases. First production build: 11.5s, clean.
- GitHub auto-deploy connected — future `main` pushes auto-deploy.
- Custom domain `ref.in-or-out.com` NOT yet set up (separate task;
  needs DNS record at the user's registrar).
- Side-finding: discovered the `platform-clubmanager` Vercel project
  is in fact the `apps/inorout` production deployment serving
  `in-or-out.com` — name is a leftover that should be renamed
  `platform-inorout` (housekeeping, separate cycle).

**Phase 5 plan approved**:
- Roadmap saved at `/Users/tarny/.claude/plans/continuing-phase-3-of-steady-falcon.md`.
- Locked architectural decisions:
  1. Trigger: per-SQUAD (not per-player). League surfaces only show
     when the player has a competitively-registered squad selected
     as their active context.
  2. UI placement: collapsible cards inside existing tabs (no new
     NavBar tabs). MySquads gets a `LEAGUE` pill on competitive
     squads.
  3. Teamsheet IS source of truth for ref pre-match — Cycle 5.6
     adds `fixture_lineups` table + RPC + backward-compatible update
     to `get_fixture_state_by_ref_token`.
  4. Naming discipline: new components use "Competition" not
     "League" to avoid collision with existing intra-squad
     `PlayerLeagueTable`.
- 7 landable cycles (5.1–5.7), one cycle per session, each with its
  own plan-mode pass.

**Skills framework hardened (commit `cc9e711`)**:
- `Skills/casual-regression.md` — mandatory for any Phase 5+ cycle
  touching `apps/inorout/src/` or `packages/core/`. Codifies the
  "casual is sacred" constraint as a procedure: 20-surface
  inventory, two-token smoke test, console diff, screenshot diff,
  real-device test.
- `Skills/ephemeral-verify.md` — mandatory for any new write RPC.
  Reusable DO-block-with-RAISE-EXCEPTION-rollback template +
  leak-check query. Codifies the pattern we hand-wrote in Cycles
  3.5, 3.6, mig 127.
- CLAUDE.md: hard-rule #14 added (forward-consumer tracking in
  RPCS.md). Skills directory + situation-specific triggers updated.
  Two new "never commit without…" gates added.
- RPCS.md: new "Consumers — forward dependency tracking" section.
- Skills/audit.md + Skills/post-incident.md extended.
- SessionStart hook lists both new skills so they auto-load every
  new chat.

**Tomorrow's safe-deploy plan**:
- Everything that needed to deploy this session has deployed
  (cycles 3.3/3.4/3.6 committed to main → auto-deployed to
  platform-ref.vercel.app; mig 127 applied via MCP).
- Tomorrow's real-world test: open
  `https://platform-ref.vercel.app/ref/<demo-token>` on a real
  iPhone, walk through a Start → events → full time flow,
  observe.
- Next coding session: Cycle 5.1 (smallest, lowest risk — RPC for
  competitive context detection + LEAGUE pill on MySquads).

**Latent items flagged**:
- `Skills/` vs `skills/` directory case mismatch (macOS-only
  passable, breaks on Linux).
- `platform-clubmanager` Vercel project → should rename to
  `platform-inorout`.
- The dead `inor-out` Vercel project (linked to a separate old
  GitHub repo) should be deleted.
- Vercel preview env vars not set for platform-ref (only production
  + development) — CLI bug workaround needed.

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 3 CYCLE 3.2a SHIPPED (session 50, 2026-05-27)

**Small follow-on to 3.2.** The 3.2 ref RPCs broadcast to both teams'
`team_live:*` channels — fine for inorout team-admin tabs (which
subscribe), useless for the venue admin watching from the office on
the venue dashboard (different surface, different token, never
subscribed). This cycle wires venue-level broadcasts so the
operator's dashboard updates live too.

Shipped:
- **Migration 121** adds `notify_venue_change(p_venue_id, p_reason)`
  helper — mirror of `notify_team_change` but uses
  `venues.live_channel_key` and publishes on `venue_live:<key>`
  channel (public, same private=false pattern). Whitelist starts with
  the 3 Phase-3 reasons (`match_started`, `match_event_recorded`,
  `match_result_saved`) and can grow.
- Tiny private helper `_ref_venue_id_for_fixture(p_fixture)` walks
  competition → season → league → venue. Both helpers explicitly
  revoked from anon + authenticated (Supabase auto-grant gotcha).
- All 7 ref RPCs re-created with an extra
  `PERFORM notify_venue_change(<venue_id>, <reason>)` call right
  after the home/away team broadcasts. Bodies otherwise byte-identical
  to mig 120.
- `apps/venue/src/App.jsx` now imports the `supabase` client and adds
  a useEffect that opens `venue_live:<live_channel_key>` once the
  venue state loads. On any broadcast it re-fetches `venueGetState`.
  Cleanup via `supabase.removeChannel(ch)` on unmount/dep-change.
  The channel key is delivered to the client via the existing
  `venue_get_state` response shape — no new RPC needed.

End-to-end verified: opened `/venue/demo_venue_token_DO_NOT_USE_IN_PROD`
in a browser, fired `ref_start_match` + `ref_record_goal` from the
SQL editor against a demo fixture; console showed
`[venue] subscribed to venue_live:demo_ven…` then two
`[venue] live update` messages (one per RPC), each triggering a
re-fetch. Smoke fixture reset back to `allocated` after.

What's NOT in this cycle (still deferred):
- Phase 4 reception display channel (TBD: `venue_live` reuse vs.
  `display:<display_token>` per the audit's recommendation).
- Push notifications for any ref event — by design, this stays
  silent/in-tab only.

Files touched:
- `rls_migrations/121_phase3_ref_venue_broadcasts.sql` (+ `_down.sql`)
- `apps/venue/src/App.jsx` (+13 lines for the subscriber)

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 3 CYCLE 3.2 SHIPPED (session 50, 2026-05-27)

**Cycle 3.2 — Server side of the live match (RPCs only, no UI)** —
medium risk; second of six Phase 3 cycles per plan
`~/.claude/plans/plain-english-please-jazzy-spring.md`.

Built the entire ref-side write surface in one migration. UI ships in
Cycle 3.3.

**Shipped:**

- **Migration 120** (`120_phase3_ref_match_writes.sql`):
  - Schema additions:
    - `match_events.client_event_id uuid UNIQUE` — every ref tap
      generates a client UUID; `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on insert
      makes offline replay strictly idempotent (no double-counted
      goals).
    - `fixtures.actual_kickoff_at timestamptz` — server-recorded
      kickoff moment, lets the ref tab compute a live MM:SS timer
      that survives reloads + offline gaps.
    - `audit_events.actor_type` CHECK extended to include `'referee'`.
  - `notify_team_change` whitelist extended with two new reasons:
    `match_started` and `match_event_recorded` (same-commit-as-callers
    discipline per §6.3 lesson — mig 049 retro-fix taught us this).
  - Private helper `_ref_resolve_fixture(p_ref_token)` — token →
    fixture lookup, raises `invalid_ref_token` on miss. Explicitly
    revoked from anon + authenticated (Supabase auto-grants every
    public-schema function; `REVOKE FROM PUBLIC` alone doesn't catch
    those roles — a hidden gotcha we'd never hit before).
  - Updated `get_fixture_state_by_ref_token` to return
    `actual_kickoff_at` (additive, no consumer breakage).
  - **Seven SECURITY DEFINER ref RPCs**, all token-gated via the
    helper, all writing an `audit_events` row per hard-rule #9, all
    firing `notify_team_change` for home + away after every successful
    insert per hard-rule #10:
    - `ref_start_match(ref_token, client_event_id, local_timestamp)` →
      flips `status='allocated'/'scheduled' → 'in_progress'`, records
      `actual_kickoff_at`, inserts a `period_change` event with
      `period='1H'`. Broadcasts `match_started`.
    - `ref_record_goal(ref_token, player_id, minute, period,
      client_event_id, own_goal, local_timestamp)` — resolves scorer's
      team via `player_registrations`. `own_goal=true` stores
      `event_type='own_goal'` with `team_id = scorer's own team`
      (counts for the OTHER team in score materialisation).
    - `ref_record_card(ref_token, player_id, minute, period, colour,
      client_event_id, local_timestamp)` — `colour ∈ {yellow,red}`.
    - `ref_record_substitution(ref_token, on_player_id, off_player_id,
      minute, period, client_event_id, local_timestamp)` — both
      players must be on the same team's roster.
    - `ref_set_period(ref_token, period, client_event_id,
      local_timestamp)` — `period ∈ {HT,2H,ET1,ET2,PEN}`; inserts a
      `period_change` event.
    - `ref_undo_event(ref_token, client_event_id)` — DELETE by
      `client_event_id`; idempotent (treats missing row as no-op).
      Server enforces only that the fixture is still `in_progress`;
      the 30-second undo window is a client-side decision.
    - `ref_confirm_full_time(ref_token)` — materialises scores from
      `match_events`:
        - `home_score = goals(home_team) + own_goals(away_team)`
        - `away_score = mirror`
      Transitions `status='in_progress' → 'completed'`. Broadcasts
      `match_result_saved` (already on whitelist). Standings are
      derived on-read by `get_league_standings_for_player`; no
      separate cascade needed.
  - **Demo seed**: 5 players per demo team registered into the demo
    competition with shirt numbers 1–5 backfilled. Idempotent
    (`ON CONFLICT (player_id, competition_id) DO NOTHING`). Without
    this Cycle 3.1's PreMatch + 3.2's event RPCs both ran against
    empty squads — squads now populated for end-to-end smoke testing.

- **JS wrappers** added to `packages/core/storage/supabase.js`
  exported via the barrel: `refStartMatch`, `refRecordGoal`,
  `refRecordCard`, `refRecordSubstitution`, `refSetPeriod`,
  `refUndoEvent`, `refConfirmFullTime`. Each raw snake_case RPC name
  appears in exactly one `supabase.rpc()` call (hard-rule #7
  satisfied).

**Realtime wiring (the bit the user flagged risk on):**

The audit found `notify_team_change` already exists (mig 062 +
049 + 117), already publishes to `team_live:<live_channel_key>`,
already public-channel-not-private, and `apps/inorout/src/App.jsx`
lines 786–827 already subscribe + re-fetch on broadcast. **Zero new
realtime infrastructure required** — every ref event simply fans
out two `notify_team_change` calls (home + away), and both team
admin tabs update without any client-side change.

Whitelist hygiene: the two new reasons (`match_started`,
`match_event_recorded`) were added to the function body in the
SAME migration as the calling RPCs, avoiding the §6.3 drift bug
(mig 049 had to retro-fix `player_account_deleted` after the fact).

**Smoke-tested end-to-end** against the demo fixture
`Alpha United vs Delta FC`:
- Start match (status → in_progress), 3 regular goals, 1 own-goal,
  1 yellow card, 1 substitution, HT, 2H, 1 goal-then-undo, full
  time confirm.
- Final score: 2–2 (math checks: 2 home goals + 0 own_goals from
  away = 2; 1 away goal + 1 own_goal from home = 2).
- 12 audit rows by `referee`, 9 surviving match_events (undone
  event correctly deleted), idempotent retry of a goal RPC with
  the same `client_event_id` was a clean no-op.
- Zero `unknown reason` warnings in postgres log during the run —
  whitelist extension worked.
- Fixture reset back to `allocated` so Cycle 3.3 has a fresh slate.

**RPC security sweep**: all 7 RPCs pass — SECURITY DEFINER, search
path locked to `public, pg_temp`, `EXECUTE` granted to `anon` +
`authenticated`, no overloads, helper properly private.

**Files touched:**
- `rls_migrations/120_phase3_ref_match_writes.sql` (+ `_down.sql`)
- `packages/core/storage/supabase.js` (+7 wrappers, +read-RPC update)
- `packages/core/index.js` (+7 exports)

**What's next:** Cycle 3.3 — the live match UI in `apps/ref/`
(LiveMatch.jsx) wiring the buttons to the 7 RPCs. Online-only first;
the offline queue is the standalone Cycle 3.4.

---

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 3 CYCLE 3.1 SHIPPED (session 50, 2026-05-27)

**Cycle 3.1 — Pre-match: ref logs in and sees the squads** (low risk,
pure read + UI; first of six Phase 3 cycles per the plan
`~/.claude/plans/plain-english-please-jazzy-spring.md`).

Shipped:
- **Migration 119** (`119_phase3_ref_get_fixture_state.sql`) — new
  `get_fixture_state_by_ref_token(p_ref_token)` SECURITY DEFINER RPC.
  Returns one fixture + competition + venue + league + pitch +
  official + both teams + both squads (derived from
  `player_registrations` joined to `players`, ordered by
  shirt_number) + any existing `match_events` for resume. Single-
  fixture access only — token grants access to nothing else.
  Grants: `anon, authenticated`.
- **JS wrapper** `getFixtureStateByRefToken(refToken)` in
  `packages/core/storage/supabase.js`, exported from the barrel.
- **New app `apps/ref/`** (Vite + React, port 5180) — mirrors
  `apps/venue/` shape: `package.json`, `vite.config.js`,
  `index.html`, `vercel.json` (catch-all → index.html),
  `src/main.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`, `src/styles.css`.
- **Visual baseline**: shares Geist + coral accent with apps/venue
  but strips glass effects, drifting orbs, and shimmer — refs need
  outdoor-readable contrast and large tap targets, not flourish.
  Auto light/dark via `prefers-color-scheme`. Min 56px buttons.
- **`PreMatch.jsx` view**:
  - Header eyebrow (venue · competition · week)
  - Kickoff strip (time + date / pitch + ref)
  - Two squad cards (team swatch from primary_colour, shirt number
    + player name + suspension flag if `suspension_until` future)
  - Empty squad state ("No confirmed squad yet")
  - Terminal-state banner (`completed` / `void` / `postponed` /
    `walkover` / `forfeit`) — surfaces final score, replaces Start
    Match with a Refresh
  - **Start Match button**: enabled within 15 min of kickoff; outside
    that window, requires a 3-second pointer hold to override (RAF-
    driven progress fill on the button, countdown hint underneath)
  - The actual `ref_start_match` RPC ships in Cycle 3.2 — the tap
    handler currently surfaces an alert pointing forward.
- **Smoke-tested** at 390×844 against two real demo fixtures:
  a completed fixture (4–2 Alpha United vs Bravo Athletic, Wed 13
  May) shows the terminal-state path; a future allocated fixture
  (Wed 3 Jun, Alpha United vs Delta FC) shows the gated Start
  Match with "Unlocks in 7 days" hint.

**RPC security sweep passed**: `security_definer: true`,
`search_path: public, pg_temp`, EXECUTE granted to both `anon` and
`authenticated`, no overloads.

**Demo seed gap noted**: `player_registrations` rows aren't seeded
for the demo teams, so squads render as empty in the current demo.
Not a blocker for Cycle 3.1 (squad rendering verified empty + non-
empty paths work); will be addressed when Cycle 3.3 needs live
squads for event entry, or sooner via a dedicated seed cycle.

**Files touched**:
- `rls_migrations/119_phase3_ref_get_fixture_state.sql` (+ `_down.sql`)
- `packages/core/storage/supabase.js` (+wrapper)
- `packages/core/index.js` (+export)
- `apps/ref/` (new app)

**What's next**: Cycle 3.2 — server-side event-write RPCs +
`client_event_id UNIQUE` column on `match_events` + realtime
broadcasts (so Phase 4 reception display can subscribe later).

---

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 2 COMPLETE (session 48, 2026-05-27)

All 8 cycles shipped. The venue admin can now, from a single
browser window: onboard the venue, define one or more leagues,
create a season, generate fixtures across multiple competitions,
approve incoming team registrations, assign pitches + refs to
fixtures, change fixture statuses (postpone / void / walkover /
forfeit), withdraw or expel mid-season teams (with cascade), and
maintain pitches + officials. Demo venue (`demo_venue_token_DO_NOT_USE_IN_PROD`,
league code `DEMO0001`) exercises every surface end-to-end.

**Cycles** (in shipped order):
- **2.1** Foundation + operator-led onboarding — migs 083–085 + 088 hotfix
- **2.2** Read RPCs — `venue_get_state`, `league_get_state`,
  `join_get_league_by_code`, `get_league_standings_for_player` —
  migs 086–087 + 089 hotfix
- **2.3** Engines (round-robin + cup) + `venue_create_season` +
  `venue_generate_fixtures` — migs 090–091 + 092 hotfix
- **2.4** Fixture management RPCs (`venue_assign_pitch`,
  `venue_assign_ref`, `venue_update_fixture_status`) + forfeit
  columns — migs 093–096
- **2.5a** Team registration via `/join/CODE` —
  `join_register_team`, `venue_approve_team_registration`,
  `venue_reject_team_registration` — migs 097–100
- **2.5b** Mid-season failures (`venue_withdraw_team`,
  `venue_expel_team`) + standings cascade incl. forfeit — migs 101–104
- **2.6** Refs + pitches CRUD + maintenance-window enforcement —
  migs 105–109
- **2.7a** Demo venue seed + upcoming-filter hotfix + date
  relativisation — migs 110–112
- **2.7c** Venue dashboard scaffold — new `apps/venue/` Vite+React app
- **2.7d** Dashboard write surfaces + teams directory — mig 113
- **2.8** Season-setup wizard (5-step modal-over-dashboard) —
  mig 114

**Phase 2 leftovers** (carved out deliberately during the cycles —
each small enough to be a single sub-cycle when picked up):
- 2.7b email dispatcher
- 2.9 visual overhaul (drawers + numbered panels + toasts + Framer
  Motion, per the design-tool mockups)
- 2.10 dedicated sub-routes (Fixtures detail / Results / Teams /
  Players / Officials / Pitches / Incidents / Registrations /
  Reports / Settings)
- 2.11 Google OAuth for venue admin
- 2.12 fixture detail page + per-fixture notes

**Remaining phases** (per LEAGUE_MODE_SCOPE.md):
- Phase 3 — Ref view (5 days, "most complex single feature")
- Phase 4 — Reception display (3 days)
- Phase 5 — Player + team-admin competitive (5 days)
- Phase 6 — HQ dashboard (6 days)
- Phase 7 — AI layer / Ask the Gaffer evolved (8 days, largest)
- Phase 8 — Billing + self-serve (5 days, deferred to year 2)
- Phase 9 — Notifications + comms (3 days)
- Phase 10 — Public league pages (2 days, smallest / highest leverage)
- Phase 11 — Cups + knockouts polish (4 days)

Total remaining nominal estimate: ~41 days, plus the ~5 days of
carved-out Phase 2 leftovers.

---

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 2 CYCLE 2.8 SHIPPED (session 48, 2026-05-27)

Season-setup wizard. The operator's path from "I want to run a new
season" to "fixtures are persisted and live on the dashboard" is now
a single 5-step flow.

- **mig 114** — `venue_list_active_teams(p_venue_token)` — venue-scoped
  team directory (wider than `venue_get_state.teams` which is
  competition-scoped). Returns every competitive team registered
  into any competition under the caller's venue.
- **`SeasonWizard.jsx`** — single-file multi-step wizard with 5
  inline step components: Basics / Competitions / Teams / Preview /
  Confirm. Modal-over-dashboard, launched from a "Set up new season"
  topbar button.
- Reuses existing engines (`generateRoundRobin`,
  `generateCupBracket`) for client-side fixture preview, and
  existing RPCs (`venueCreateSeason`, `venueGenerateFixtures`) for
  persistence.
- Engine `pitch_index` → `playing_area_id` translation in the submit
  handler, mapping through `season.pitches[index]`.
- Modal extended with a `wide` prop (880px max-width) for the
  wizard layout.

Visual mockups from external design tool reviewed this session but
deliberately NOT adopted — user direction was "build first,
redesign later." Mockup adoption tracked as Cycle 2.9 leftover.

---

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 2 CYCLE 2.7d SHIPPED (session 48, 2026-05-26)

Venue dashboard write surfaces. Five action paths from UI through
to live RPCs.

- **Modal pattern** (`Modal.jsx`) — generic dialog reused across
  every write surface. Backdrop blur, Esc-to-close, header/body/foot.
- **Approve/Reject team registration** — Open Issues panel.
  Approve = 1-click. Reject = modal with required reason.
- **Assign pitch** — fixture row → modal → dropdown with
  maintenance-window blocked options pre-disabled.
- **Assign ref** — fixture row → modal → ref dropdown with
  channel + rating shown inline.
- **Change fixture status** — fixture row → modal with status
  picker that branches required fields (postpone/void → reason;
  walkover → winner; forfeit → both).
- **Add/Edit pitch** — sidebar "+ Add" + per-row "Edit" → modal
  with dynamic maintenance-window editor + active/is_available
  toggles.
- **Add/Edit ref** — same pattern; channel + employment_type
  dropdowns; rating numeric.

**mig 113** — `venue_get_state` adds top-level `teams` directory
keyed by team_id (closes the team-name-as-raw-id shortcut from 2.7c).

End-to-end verified via Playwright against the live demo venue:
clicked Approve on a seeded pending registration → DB state flipped
+ audit row written + dashboard refreshed with the row gone.

**Polish deferred to an external design-tool pass** (Framer Motion
animations, optimistic UI, toast notifications) — brief sent to
user this session, written in Vite+React+vanilla-CSS constraints.

**Phase 2 remaining:** Cycles 2.7b (email dispatcher), 2.8 (wizard
UI for season setup).

---

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 2 CYCLE 2.7c SHIPPED (session 48, 2026-05-26)

First clickable Phase 2 surface. New `apps/venue/` React app
(10 files: package.json, vite config, vercel config, index.html,
main.jsx, styles.css, App.jsx, Dashboard.jsx, FixtureCard.jsx,
Sidebar.jsx).

- Token-from-URL auth (`?token=` query param or `/venue/TOKEN` path).
- Six-panel responsive layout: Tonight / This Week / Open Issues
  / Recent / Upcoming / Sidebar (pitches + refs).
- Powered entirely by `venue_get_state` (1 round trip per load).
- Score branching covers completed / walkover / forfeit. Status
  pill labels: "Needs pitch" / "Needs ref" / "All set" / "Result"
  / "Walkover" / "Forfeit" / "Postponed" / "Void".
- Maintenance windows surface as a count badge in the sidebar
  pitch list.
- Read-only — no buttons mutate state yet.

Verified end-to-end via Playwright against the live demo venue
(`demo_venue_token_DO_NOT_USE_IN_PROD`). All panels render with
real data; zero console errors apart from missing favicon.

**Known shortcut**: fixture team names render as raw IDs because
venue_get_state doesn't include a team-name directory. Cycle 2.7d
will fix.

**To deploy**: add `apps/venue/` as a new Vercel project + set
`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` + `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` env vars
(operator action).

**Phase 2 remaining:** Cycle 2.7d (write surfaces — approve/reject
buttons, fixture mgmt modals, pitch/ref CRUD forms), 2.7b (email
dispatcher), 2.8 (wizard UI).

---

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 2 CYCLE 2.7a SHIPPED (session 48, 2026-05-26)

End-to-end demo venue seed driving every Phase 2 RPC (migs 110–112).

- **mig 110 — demo venue seed.** Idempotent DO block: venue + league
  + 2 pitches (one with future MW) + 3 refs + season + competition
  + 4 teams + 6 round-robin fixtures (3 completed, 1 walkover, 2
  allocated upcoming) + 1 player. Dates are CURRENT_DATE-relative.
- **mig 111 — venue_get_state + league_get_state upcoming filter
  fix.** Latent bug surfaced by the seed: allocated fixtures were
  excluded from the upcoming bucket, so a pitched fixture would
  vanish until kickoff day. Fix: include 'allocated' alongside
  'scheduled' and 'postponed'.
- **mig 112 — date reshuffle.** One-off live-data fix for the
  initially seeded hardcoded dates (mig 110 source now uses
  current_date-relative arithmetic so future re-seeds are correct
  from the start).

Cycle 2.7 originally scoped as frontend + email + demo together;
split into sub-cycles 2.7a–2.7d. This is a.

**Phase 2 remaining (post Cycle 2.7c):** Cycle 2.7d shipped — see
above. Remaining: 2.7b (email dispatcher), 2.8 (wizard UI).

---

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 2 CYCLE 2.6 SHIPPED (session 48, 2026-05-26)

Refs + pitches CRUD plus the maintenance-window enforcement deferred
from Cycle 2.4 (migrations 105–109). Backend half of Phase 2 complete.

- **mig 105** — `venue_add_pitch` — create row with optional
  surface, capacity, sort_order, is_available, maintenance_windows.
- **mig 106** — `venue_update_pitch` — partial update via jsonb;
  soft-delete via active=false; broadcast switches to `pitch_closed`
  on the true→false flip.
- **mig 107** — `venue_add_ref` — create row; preferred_channel +
  employment_type defaulted; table CHECKs enforce enum values.
- **mig 108** — `venue_update_ref` — partial update mirror.
- **mig 109** — `venue_assign_pitch` rewrite — enforces
  `maintenance_windows` overlap against fixture's `scheduled_date`,
  rejects with `pitch_in_maintenance`. Skips check when no date set.

**Phase 2 remaining:** Cycles 2.7 (frontend + email dispatcher + demo
venue seed), 2.8 (wizard UI). All backend RPCs now live.

---

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 2 CYCLE 2.5b SHIPPED (session 48, 2026-05-26)

Mid-season team-exit flows + standings cascade for forfeit
(migrations 101–104).

- **mig 101** — `competition_teams.expulsion_reason` + extends
  `notify_venue_change` / `notify_league_change` whitelists with
  `team_expelled` and `fixtures_cascaded`.
- **mig 102 — `venue_withdraw_team`** — pending/active → withdrawn,
  cascade remaining fixtures (walkover to opposing team; void on
  phantom byes). Idempotent.
- **mig 103 — `venue_expel_team`** — active → expelled, same cascade.
  Distinguishable from withdrawal via `void_reason` / status.
- **mig 104 — `get_league_standings_for_player`** rewritten — now
  counts forfeit fixtures (3-0 to forfeit_winner_id, mirror of the
  existing walkover branch). Withdrawn/expelled teams stay in
  standings with accumulated pre-exit points.

Pitch close (maintenance windows) → Cycle 2.6. Ref no-show already
supported via Cycle 2.4's assign_ref(NULL)+reassign.

**Phase 2 remaining (post Cycle 2.7a):** Cycles 2.7b (email
dispatcher), 2.7c/d (venue dashboard frontend), 2.8 (wizard UI).

---

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 2 CYCLE 2.5a SHIPPED (session 48, 2026-05-26)

Self-serve team registration backend for `/join/CODE` — three RPCs +
one schema add (migrations 097–100).

- **mig 097** — `competition_teams.rejection_reason text` (additive).
- **mig 098 — `join_register_team`** — authenticated-only public RPC.
  Creates a competitive team OR promotes an existing casual one,
  claims caller as `team_admin`, inserts `competition_teams(status=
  'pending')`. Guards duplicate registration on same team_id.
- **mig 099 — `venue_approve_team_registration`** — pending→active,
  idempotent on already-active.
- **mig 100 — `venue_reject_team_registration`** — pending→rejected
  with required reason captured in `rejection_reason`.

Squad collection deferred: the team admin uses the existing
AdminView SquadScreen post-approval. Notification delivery to team
admin (push/email) deferred to Cycle 2.7 — RPCs emit audit + broadcast
hooks so the dispatcher can subscribe.

**Phase 2 remaining (post Cycle 2.7a):** Cycles 2.7b (email
dispatcher), 2.7c/d (venue dashboard frontend), 2.8 (wizard UI).

---

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 2 CYCLE 2.4 SHIPPED (session 48, 2026-05-26)

Fixture management RPCs for the operator dashboard. Three single-row
mutating RPCs + a forfeit-storage schema addition (migrations 093–096).

- **mig 093** — `fixtures.forfeit_winner_id` (text FK → teams ON
  DELETE SET NULL) + `fixtures.forfeit_reason`. `fixtures_status_check`
  expanded additively to include `'forfeit'`. Caught proactively by
  the new `pg_constraint` sweep mandate.
- **mig 094 — `venue_assign_pitch`** — sets/clears
  `fixtures.playing_area_id`. Auto-bumps scheduled↔allocated. Validates
  pitch is active + is_available + in caller's venue.
- **mig 095 — `venue_assign_ref`** — sets/clears `fixtures.official_id`.
  Audit/broadcast distinguishes assigned / changed / cleared.
- **mig 096 — `venue_update_fixture_status`** — drives the four
  operator-initiated terminal transitions (postpone, void, walkover,
  forfeit) with per-status validation + winner/reason metadata.

Standings update for forfeit (and the team-withdrawal cascade)
deferred to Cycle 2.5b, per the deferral already documented in mig 087.

**Phase 2 remaining:** Cycles 2.5a (team registration), 2.5b
(mid-season failures + standings cascade), 2.6 (refs+pitches CRUD),
2.7 (frontend + email + demo venue), 2.8 (wizard UI). ~3–4 days.

---

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASE 2 CYCLES 2.1–2.3 SHIPPED (session 48, 2026-05-26)

The first half of Phase 2 (League Mode customer-visible surfaces) is
live as DB + JS modules. Cycles 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 shipped end-to-end with
matching `_down.sql` files and proactive in-flight CHECK-constraint
hotfixes.

**Cycle 2.1 — Foundation + operator-led onboarding (commit `03bd4be`):**
- Migs 083–085: `venues.live_channel_key`, `leagues.league_code` (8-char
  alphanumeric) + `live_channel_key` + `squad_mode` + `squad_mode_locked_at`
  + `standings_visibility`, `match_officials.employment_type` +
  `overall_rating`, `playing_areas.is_available` + `maintenance_windows`,
  `competition_teams.status` DEFAULT flipped to `'pending'`.
- Resolver helpers: `resolve_venue_caller`, `resolve_league_caller`.
- Realtime publishers: `notify_venue_change` (25 reasons),
  `notify_league_change` (11 reasons) — separate
  `venue_live:`/`league_live:` channels from `team_live:`.
- **Primary onboarding tool**: `superadmin_create_venue` RPC +
  `/superadmin/venues/new` form on `apps/superadmin`. Self-serve
  signup (original Phase 8) deferred to year 2 per DECISIONS.md.

**Cycle 2.2 — Read RPCs (commit `f940c32`):**
- `venue_get_state` — full venue dashboard payload with fixtures
  bucketed tonight / this_week / upcoming / recent.
- `league_get_state` — narrower deep-link, falls back to league-pick
  prompt when caller is a venue admin.
- `join_get_league_by_code` — public `/join/CODE` landing.
- `get_league_standings_for_player` — W/D/L/GF/GA/GD/Pts across every
  competition the player is in; walkovers default to 3-0; top scorers
  stubbed until Phase 3 `match_events`.

**Cycle 2.3 — Engines + season setup (commit `71b8aab`):**
- `packages/core/engine/roundRobin.js` — circle method with home/away
  balance, pitch×slot allocation, doubleRound mirror, excludeWeeks.
- `packages/core/engine/cupBracket.js` — single elim (byes to top
  seeds + bracket placeholders) + group stage (snake-seeded).
- `venue_create_season` RPC — creates season + competitions, validates
  league ownership + date order + types.
- `venue_generate_fixtures` RPC — bulk-persists engine output, validates
  everything (competition ownership, no existing fixtures, every team
  active, every date in season, every pitch in venue), **one audit
  row** per generation.

**In-flight CHECK-constraint hotfixes** (migs 088/089/092 — full
detail in BUGS.md): `competition_teams.status` enum, RPC body
references to non-existent `incidents.status` + invalid
`'registration_open'`, `audit_events.actor_type` whitelist. Pattern
captured in DECISIONS.md "SCHEMA-SYNC MUST SWEEP `pg_constraint`".

**Customer-visible impact: zero (Phase 2 frontend lives in Cycle 2.7).**
Backend ready for the wizard UI; superadmin onboarding form ships
but pending the `apps/superadmin` env-var fix in BUGS.md.

**Decisions captured in DECISIONS.md (session 48):**
- Operator-led onboarding for year 1, Phase 8 deferred.
- `/league/TOKEN` merges into `/venue/TOKEN`.
- Existing casual teams stay venueless forever.
- Squad mode per-league, locked at first fixture.
- Bulk-RPCs audit one row, not N.

**Phase 2 remaining (post Cycle 2.7a):** Cycles 2.7b (email
dispatcher), 2.7c/d (venue dashboard frontend), 2.8 (wizard UI).

---

## LEAGUE MODE — PHASES 0 + 1 SHIPPED (session 40, 2026-05-25)

Two phases of `LEAGUE_MODE_SCOPE.md` landed end-to-end:

**Phase 0 — Foundation (migrations 050–054):**
- `league_config` table + `useLeagueConfig` hook + multi-sport posture
- `matches.match_type`, `teams.team_type`, `player_match.match_type` columns
- `notify.js` channel abstraction (dry-run by default; Phase 9 plugs Twilio)
- `company_domains` table + AuthCallback hook
- `create_team` RPC extended with `p_team_type` (default 'casual')
- `player_career` split into casual_*/competitive_*/total_* + `sync_player_career` RPC

**Phase 1 — Core data model (migrations 055–057):**
- 20 new tables: companies, company_admins, billing_events, clubs, venues,
  venue_admins, `playing_areas` (multi-sport rename of `pitches`),
  `match_officials` (multi-sport rename of `referees`), leagues, seasons,
  competitions, club_teams, competition_teams, team_name_history,
  cup_rounds, fixtures, match_events, player_registrations, incidents,
  hq_preview_tokens
- 13 new columns on existing tables (teams, matches, players, player_match)
- Phase-0 FK constraints retroactively added; `get_company_by_domain`
  extended to JOIN companies

**Multi-sport posture recorded in DECISIONS.md (session 40).** Zero
renames of existing identifiers; all new identifiers generic; future
sport-specific stats go into a `sport_stats jsonb` column when sport #2
lands.

**Customer-visible impact: zero.** Spine in place; Phase 2 will be the
first phase that builds customer-facing surfaces on top.

**Also this session:** MyView double-count hotfix (PlayerView.jsx — was
adding ledger balance + this-week's price for a phantom £10 instead of
the real £5). Commits `a8dd46d` + `ab6484f`.

| ScheduleScreen + TeamsScreen polish | ✅ | Glass form sections, gold-glow titles, hardcoded radii (8/10/12/20) replaced with token vars. No interaction change. — session 35 |
| Player self-profile screen | ✅ | New unified PlayerProfile.jsx. Avatar overlay top-left on PageHeader (also recentred IN OR OUT logo). Three lazy-load sections: Stats / Payment History / Injuries. Migration 039 (get_my_payment_history + get_my_injuries). — session 35 (PROFILE_SCOPE A) |
| Leave squad (self) | ✅ | Two-tap confirm. Refuses with `debt_owed:<amount>` if owes > 0. Detaches team_players + push_subscriptions; preserves player row + history. Migration 040 (leave_squad RPC). — session 35 (PROFILE_SCOPE B) |

Anonymises players row (name → "Deleted player") preserving FKs; detaches all teams; deletes push_subscriptions + player_career; revokes admin grants; calls auth.admin.deleteUser via /api/delete-account edge function. Refuses with `last_admin:<csv>` if user is sole admin of any team. Migration 040 (delete_my_account RPC). — session 35 (PROFILE_SCOPE B) |
| PlayerProfile admin mode merge | ✅ | Single file serves both modes behind isAdminView prop. Admin mode adds "Admin view" pill, branched RPCs (admin paths), ROLES with VC toggle, Admin Actions card (Rename/Copy/Reset link/Mark injury), Remove from squad with has_history guard surfaced. AdminView/PlayerProfile.jsx (374 LOC) deleted. — session 35 (PROFILE_SCOPE C) |
| First-time-use tooltips | ✅ | New `FirstTimeHint` primitive (framer-motion + localStorage, chained via `prerequisite` key, `ioo-hint-dismissed` event syncs duplicate mounts). 12 hints across AdminView (live-toggle global, key preserved), Squad invite link, Teams (tiles → SMART → CONFIRM chained), Payments unpaid section, Bibs holder, PlayerView status grid, StatsView league table (H2H discovery), HistoryView first match, PlayerProfile leave button. Pre-execute audit confirmed zero DB/RPC/auth/env touched. — session 38 |
| Pre-Beta launch fix: player_join_team token | ✅ | Migration 044. New-player INSERT branch now generates a player token. Pre-fix, first-time joiners landed with NULL token → JoinSuccess.jsx fell back to `/`. Caught and fixed in the audit before the real team's invite link went out. — session 39 |
| Super-admin dashboard Phase 1+2 (read-only) | ✅ | New `apps/superadmin` app at `https://platform-superadmin-djj9b1w8x-tarny-s-projects.vercel.app`, Vercel SSO-gated. Three tabs: Activity (audit_events tail), Teams (sortable list), Team Detail (drilldown). Migrations 045 (platform_admins + is_platform_admin + superadmin_whoami) + 046 (3 read RPCs). All RPCs gated by global cross-team auth helper. Phase 3 (token rescue) + Phase 4 (data fix) write tools deferred. — session 39 |
| Workspace-deps guard hook | ✅ | New `Skills/scripts/check-workspace-deps.sh`. Validates every `@platform/*` dep in every `apps/*/package.json` + `packages/*/package.json` maps to a real workspace package — wired into the pre-commit build gate. Sub-second jq check. Makes the "fake-alias-as-dep" bug class (which broke platform-clubmanager's CI when superadmin shipped) structurally impossible going forward. Plus `@platform/supabase` alias eliminated entirely; 22 source files migrated to import from `@platform/core/storage/supabase.js`. — session 39 |
| Push notification pipeline operational | ✅ | Three-layer fix: VAPID env vars set with real values (were stored as empty strings since the original platform-clubmanager deploy 13 days prior), all 6 pg_cron jobs rewritten apex → www (apex 307s strip the Authorization header at the redirect → 401), pg_cron job 5 syntax error fixed. Verified end-to-end at the 19:45 UTC cron tick: 4× HTTP 200 vs 4× HTTP 401 at 19:30 baseline. Migration 049 adds `player_account_deleted` to `notify_team_change` whitelist. **In-app subscribe flow not yet exercised on a real device** — proof-on-device deferred. — session 39 |
| Defense-in-depth: admin_save_teams scoping | ✅ | Migration 048. Adds `team_players` scope to the two `UPDATE players SET team='A'/'B'` statements in admin_save_teams (the CLEAR was already scoped). Closes a cross-team write surface where a legit admin for team X could pass team Y player_ids in p_team_a/p_team_b and flip their team column. Verified live with adversarial + happy-path tests inside rolled-back transactions. — session 39 |

## PHASE 2 — BACKLOG (pre-broader-beta ~Jun 9)

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| BibsScreen fix under RLS | See BUGS.md #1 |
| CreateTeam email pre-fill | ✅ Done session 29 |
| "Make game live" new admin hint | ✅ Done session 29 |
| Install screen on create flow (SquadReady) | ✅ Done session 30 — shared `InstallSection` extracted from JoinSuccess, inlined into SquadReady with sticky "Go to my team" CTA. Desktop copy-link targets admin URL. |
| Last goal scorer in IO Intelligence | `last_goal_scorer` field on matches — just wire into a card |
| Bib streak insight | Consecutive bib games — data in `bib_history` |
| WhatsApp share text update | Update share copy in HistoryView |
| BibsScreen RLS write fix | BibsScreen redesigned ✅; standalone write still broken — see BUGS.md #2 |
| **Smart Teams TeamsScreen redesign** | ✅ Session 31 — full live-board rewrite. Auto-Smart fires on entry when no teams set; LiveBoard mirrors PlayerView's confirmed-teams tile (Team A \| B grid with chips); tap-to-move between teams; SMART panel open from start with Group 1 + Group 2 seeded; BUILD TEAMS contextual CTA only when groups dirty; prediction recomputes on every manual move; prediction chip hides when one side is empty; PLAYERS row list removed entirely; bottom CONFIRM TEAMS button (was ambiguous "DONE"). |
| **Smart Teams adoption analytics** | ✅ Session 31 — `team_confirmed` PostHog event as analytical anchor + `team_drafted_auto` / `team_player_moved` / `team_regenerated` / `team_cleared`. Tracks manual_moves_before/after, regenerate_count, was_ai_picked_as_is, is_recommit. Single-filter answers to "is the algorithm being trusted?" |
| **Admin home polish** | ✅ Session 31 — cancel-then-relive bug fixed via new `admin_reopen_week` RPC (creates fresh match, cancelled stays in history). Game-live toggle: "Make this week's game live" when off; collapses to a "LIVE" badge when on (no toggle, admin uses Cancel This Week). This Week tiles moved up to immediately after the toggle. Notifications block removed from Match Settings (duplicate of Notifications tab, demo confusion). |
| **Player status tile rework** | ✅ Session 31 — weekday now derives from admin-configured `dayOfWeek` first (was deriving wrong day from drifted `gameDateTime`). Locked-in banner slide-fades after 5s. Pre-response prompt nudges with "Tap below ↓"; collapses to date+kickoff after response. Status row pulses gold while unresponded; flashes status-matched colour on tap (in→green, out→red, maybe→amber, reserve→purple). Haptic tap-tick (Android only — iOS Safari no-ops). Banners suppressed on page refresh. |
| **Smart Teams** (internal: Group Balancer) | ✅ Built + live session 30 (May 22). Schema + 2 new RPCs (`admin_set_player_group`, `admin_clear_all_groups`) + 3 modified RPCs applied via migration `031_group_balancer_stage_1b`. Pure algorithm `packages/core/engine/groupBalancer.js` (sample-200 for big groups, lower-headcount odd-extra rule, win-rate-nudged splits within 5% noise floor). UI: tap-to-move panels, inline labels, IO Prediction card, Needs Group amber banner, ADD/× empty panels (panel persists once populated — × dismisses only when empty). HistoryView prediction chip (null-safe, forward-only). Replaces Fisher-Yates; no feature flag — always on. PostHog `posthog.group('team', teamId)` identification added (enables per-team analytics + future flag targeting). Deferred to Phase 2: `teams_draft` group snapshot (predicted_winner is already saved at confirm so the accuracy stat works without it). |
| **Ask the Gaffer — Phase 1 (AI agent layer)** | First production phase of the platform's AI agent layer — not a chatbot. Grounded football-operations agent (every output backed by a Supabase query, never invents facts). Phase 1 surfaces: team summary, payment summary, attendance risk, matchday briefing, Q&A panel. Provider locked in (Vercel AI Gateway → Anthropic `claude-sonnet-4-6`); data-access pattern locked in (`gaffer_get_context_*` RPCs + `ai_briefings` audit table); awaiting AI Gateway credits / Anthropic key signup before live build. Full spec: `GAFFER.md`. |
| **Marketing landing page** | Conditional render at root (Option A) for beta — unauth + no token → landing, else app shell. See DECISIONS.md. |

## PHASE 4 — LEAGUE MODE (superseded — now active)

Previously parked as a future sales pitch ("run your league free for one season"). Superseded by the active **League Mode** programme — Phases 0 + 1 already shipped (see top of file). Phase 2 onwards in `LEAGUE_MODE_SCOPE.md`.

---

## ASK THE GAFFER — AI AGENT LAYER

**This is the platform's AI agent layer, not a chatbot.** Grounded
football-operations agent. Every output backed by a Supabase query
(`context_snapshot` jsonb on every `ai_briefings` row). LLM narrates and
patterns — it never invents facts. Four-phase trust-graduated rollout.
Full spec lives in `GAFFER.md` — read that before any Gaffer work.

**Provider + data-access pattern (locked in):**
- LLM: Vercel AI Gateway → Anthropic `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- Context: per-surface `gaffer_get_context_*` RPCs (SECURITY DEFINER)
- Runtime: Vercel edge function `apps/inorout/api/gaffer.js`
- Audit: `ai_briefings` table — every output row links to its context snapshot
- Cost: ~£0.004 per briefing, £20/month covers ~5000 briefings

**Sequencing:** Phase 1 lands after Group Balancer (done s30). Group
Balancer's `generateBalancedTeams` becomes a building block for Phase 2
fair-team suggestions.

| Phase | Capability | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Read-only assistant | Q&A panel, team summary, payment summary, attendance risk, matchday briefing | 🟡 Scaffold + DB complete session 33. Migrations 033–037 applied to live DB via MCP and smoke-tested against `team_demo` (all four RPCs return real data). Edge function `/api/gaffer`, prompts, `GafferCard`, admin Q&A panel, JS wrappers all shipped. Awaiting: Anthropic key confirm on Vercel + AdminView wire-up (canary on one team first). See GAFFER.md "IMPLEMENTATION STATUS". |
| 2 — Recommendations | Fair team suggestions, reserve recs, payment chase drafts, weekly match summary, player insight explanations | 🔲 Not built |
| 3 — Confirmed actions | "Send chase", "Notify reserves", "Use these teams", "Post match summary", "Confirm payment reminders" — admin one-tap approve, all via existing SECURITY DEFINER RPCs | 🔲 Not built |
| 4 — Semi-autonomous | Auto-detect short squads, auto-draft notifications, auto-suggest reserve pings, auto-produce weekly admin report. Player-visible actions still require approval (hard rule). | 🔲 Not built |
