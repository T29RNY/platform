## LOW — Known workarounds exist

### 1. BibsScreen standalone write broken under RLS
**File:** `apps/inorout/src/views/AdminView/BibsScreen.jsx`
**Detail:** BibsScreen bib assignment lacks `matchId` + `adminToken` in scope.
Direct `insertBib` write is blocked by RLS.
**Workaround:** Bibs can be set via ScoreScreen result save (has both). Standalone
BibsScreen assignment is non-functional post-RLS.
**Fix:** Thread `adminToken` + `matchId` into BibsScreen; replace `insertBib` with
`admin_save_bib_holder` RPC call.

### 2. `player_career` mostly empty
**Detail:** Only `total_bib_count` is ever written. 11 other career fields (`total_games`,
`total_wins`, `total_losses`, `total_draws`, `total_goals`, `total_motm`,
`career_win_rate`, `career_reliability`, `career_impact`, `best_team_id`) are permanently
null/zero. Table exists but provides no value until Phase 2 career sync is built.

### 3. `team_demo` has no `team_admins` row
**Detail:** Demo team predates the `team_admins` table. Multi-team switcher won't show
`team_demo` for Tarny's account until backfilled. No impact on real teams.
**Fix:** `INSERT INTO team_admins (team_id, user_id) VALUES ('team_demo', '<tarny_user_id>');`

### 4. `scoring.js` filename mismatch
**File:** `packages/core/engine/scoring.js`
**Detail:** File hosts `periodCutoff` (a non-scoring helper) alongside `hasGoalData` +
`resolveDominantType`. Low priority until file grows further.
**Fix:** Rename to `stats-helpers.js` when adding more helpers.

## RESOLVED THIS SESSION (May 21 2026 — session 29)

- **CreateTeam email field redundant** — `authUser` now flows App.jsx → Onboarding →
  `useOnboarding`, seeding `adminEmail` from OAuth email. Input field and validation
  removed from UI. RPC call unchanged. Commit: `419fba2`
- **"Make game live" hint** — Dismissible banner added to AdminView showing when
  `gameIsLive` is false and `ioo_game_live_hint_dismissed` not set. CTA links to
  Match Settings. Permanent dismiss via localStorage. Commit: `419fba2`

## RESOLVED (May 21 2026 — session 28)

- **ScoreScreen bib eligibility 401** — replaced `getBibEligiblePlayers` direct
  `player_match` read with synchronous derivation from `squad` prop (`bibsSorted`). No new
  RPC needed. `getBibEligiblePlayers` deleted from supabase.js. Commit: `8aaae57`
- **Admin Decide button** — confirmed non-bug. `POTMTiebreakModal` auto-detects
  `adminDecisionPending` on return to AdminView. Flow works correctly.
- **insertMatch 401** — App.jsx call site removed (`setMatchHistory` made pure);
  `insertMatch` deleted from `supabase.js`.
- **upsertSchedule dead import** — removed from App.jsx imports.
- **TeamsScreen hardcoded colours** — all 5 fixed with CSS variables.
- **App.jsx dead imports** — `insertMatch`, `upsertSchedule`, `addCoverPlayer`,
  `removeCoverPlayer`, `updateCoverPlayer`, `getUser`, `getUserProfile`,
  `getTeamByPlayerToken` all removed.
- **Raw RPC in AdminView/index.jsx** — `admin_confirm_payment` extracted to
  `confirmPayment()` wrapper in supabase.js.
- **Gold hardcoded colours in AdminView/index.jsx** — replaced with `var(--goldb)` / `var(--gold2)`.
- **console.warn in App.jsx** — changed to `console.error`.
- Dead functions removed from `supabase.js`: `bulkCancelLedgerEntries`,
  `bulkResetPlayerStatuses`, `deletePlayerMatchRows`, `findPlayerByUserId`,
  `findPlayersByName`, `getPlayerByUserId`, `updateCareerBibCount`, `insertBib`,
  `addCoverPlayer`, `removeCoverPlayer`, `updateCoverPlayer`, `getBibEligiblePlayers`
- Dead payment functions removed from `payments.js`: `handleClearDebt`, `handleStripePayment`
- `IsThisYou.jsx` deleted (never routed to or imported)
- Commits: `1784b44`, `3e2bfde`, `9003865`, `6df6fcf`, `9441888`, `957f63d`, `8aaae57`
