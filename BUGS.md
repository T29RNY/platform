# In or Out — Known Bugs & Tech Debt
*Last updated: May 24 2026 (session 36 — H2H/Stats RLS RPC sweep + pre-launch motion overhaul)*

**Read this at the start of every session before touching any code.**

---

## LOW — Known workarounds exist

### 1. BibsScreen standalone write broken under RLS
**File:** `apps/inorout/src/views/AdminView/BibsScreen.jsx`
**Detail:** BibsScreen bib assignment lacks `matchId` + `adminToken` in scope.
Direct `insertBib` write is blocked by RLS.
**Workaround:** Bibs can be set via ScoreScreen result save (has both). Standalone
BibsScreen assignment is non-functional post-RLS.
**Fix:** Thread `adminToken` + `matchId` into BibsScreen; replace `insertBib` with
`admin_save_bib_holder` RPC call.

### 2. `player_career` mostly empty
**Detail:** Only `total_bib_count` is ever written. 11 other career fields (`total_games`,
`total_wins`, `total_losses`, `total_draws`, `total_goals`, `total_motm`,
`career_win_rate`, `career_reliability`, `career_impact`, `best_team_id`) are permanently
null/zero. Table exists but provides no value until Phase 2 career sync is built.

### 3. `team_demo` has no `team_admins` row ✅ RESOLVED (session 36)
~~Demo team predates the `team_admins` table.~~ Backfilled session 36 — added row
for `tarny@desicity.com` auth uid. Now mostly moot: the H2H + StatsView RPC
fixes (041, 042) mean `/demoadmin` works for unauthenticated visitors too via
the admin_token SECURITY DEFINER path.

### 4. `scoring.js` filename mismatch
**File:** `packages/core/engine/scoring.js`
**Detail:** File hosts `periodCutoff` (a non-scoring helper) alongside `hasGoalData` +
`resolveDominantType`. Low priority until file grows further.
**Fix:** Rename to `stats-helpers.js` when adding more helpers.

### 5. Cross-browser / in-app-webview install loses token breadcrumb
**Files:** `apps/inorout/src/App.jsx` (getRoute), `apps/inorout/src/views/JoinSuccess.jsx`,
`apps/inorout/src/views/SquadReady.jsx`
**Detail:** Token persistence relies on `localStorage` (`ioo_last_visited` / `ioo_redirect_to`).
localStorage is scoped per-browser-per-origin, so the breadcrumb is lost when the user
crosses browser contexts between joining and installing:
- User opens invite link in an in-app webview (Gmail, WhatsApp, Facebook, Slack), then
  taps "open in Chrome" or installs from a different browser → fresh storage, no entry.
- User joins in Chrome but installs the PWA from Samsung Internet / Firefox Android.
- Same flow on iOS in-app webviews (still hits the redirect bridge, but only if the
  install actually happens inside Safari).
Result: installed PWA opens at `/` with no breadcrumb → falls through to landing /
PWA welcome and the player has to re-paste their invite link or `/p/TOKEN` URL.
**Mitigation in place:** the user only needs to hit `/p/TOKEN` once inside the same
browser that owns the PWA install for the breadcrumb to land correctly. Most users
who tap Install in Chrome after joining are fine.
**Fix (not yet built):** server-side breadcrumb — set a signed httpOnly cookie on
`/p/TOKEN` and `/join/CODE` GET requests, and have the root `/` route check it before
falling through. Or: include the token in the PWA `start_url` per-install (requires
a server-rendered manifest). Either approach moves persistence off the client and
survives browser handoffs.

### 6. PlayerView direct `matches` table read 401s on every page load ✅ RESOLVED (session 36)
The 401s on the `from('matches')` reads were from `getHeadToHead` and
`getPlayerLeagueTable`, not PlayerView itself — both were wrapped in
SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (migrations 041 + 042) with adminToken threading.
Same pattern applies to authenticated player sessions which hit the
direct-read fallback path. Console clean post-fix.

## RESOLVED THIS SESSION (May 24 2026 — session 36)

- **H2H on /demoadmin showed "you haven't played in the same game yet"** —
  `getHeadToHead` did three direct `.from()` reads on `matches` +
  `player_match`. Under post-session-24 RLS those returned zero rows for
  anon callers; the modal silently rendered empty. Migration 041 added
  `get_head_to_head_raw_by_admin_token` (SECURITY DEFINER, derives team
  from admin_token, returns three jsonb arrays). JS branches on
  adminToken; existing computation untouched. Threaded adminToken
  through App.jsx → PlayerView/StatsView → HeadToHead. Commit: `a95e074`.
- **StatsView form chips + reliability column always blank** — same root
  cause. `getPlayerLeagueTable` did direct `.from()` reads → RLS-blocked
  on anon. StatsView's local tableData hard-coded `reliability:null` +
  `form:[]` because `matchHistory + squad` props can't derive either
  (need ordered player_match rows + all-time attended counts). Migration
  042 added `get_player_league_table_raw_by_admin_token`; StatsView now
  augments local tableData with form + reliability from the RPC. Also
  fixed HeadToHead Section 4 Overall Comparison bars on demoadmin via
  same threading. Commit: `ed92e2f`.
- **TeamsScreen — buttons "do nothing", duplicate CONFIRMs, no
  REGENERATE option** — three related UX gaps. The confirm RPC was
  firing fine but visual feedback was a tiny green toast easy to miss;
  button text never changed; admin couldn't tell anything happened.
  Plus two confirm buttons (top + bottom) doing the same thing. Plus
  BUILD TEAMS gated on `groupsDirty` so admin couldn't re-shuffle
  without first editing groups. Combined fix: dropped the duplicate
  top button + the toast; bottom button is now state-aware (assign
  first / confirm / confirming / ✓ confirmed). BUILD TEAMS always
  visible when SMART is open, with adaptive label (BUILD TEAMS when
  groups dirty, REGENERATE TEAMS otherwise). Commits: `a7e3e96`, `b257ae3`.
- **PlayerView Live Board team sheet empty after confirm** —
  `admin_save_teams` only wrote `matches.team_a/team_b` (the persistent
  match row), never `players.team` (the denormalised column PlayerView's
  Live Board reads at line 203). Migration 043 extends the RPC to clear
  + set p.team on every confirm, scoped to team via team_players join.
  Commit: `a14590b`.
- **TeamsScreen CONFIRM TEAMS button reverted to "CONFIRM" on return** —
  race condition between matchId hydration effect (which set
  teamsConfirmed=true from the loaded match) and the auto-Smart effect
  (which read empty `assignments` from its stale closure, decided
  "nothing assigned", ran the algorithm, called setTeamsConfirmed(false)).
  Whichever setState committed last won. Fix: hydration now sets
  `hasAutoFiredRef.current=true` when it detects an already-confirmed
  lineup, so auto-Smart bails before running. Commit: `a14590b`.
- **/demoadmin "me" defaulted to a leftover Test Player row** —
  the squad lookup matched `userId === session.user.id` for the auth
  user. For accounts with an orphan p_* row pointing at their uid,
  this surfaced a meaningless test player as the header avatar and
  broke every player-centric surface. demoadmin is a public showcase
  route, not identity-bound — hard-coded "me" to Hassan (`p_demo_01`),
  the demo protagonist with the richest seeded history. Commit: `dd14c6e`.
- **Dead IO Intelligence query block** — 10 supabase.js functions
  (`getPlayerMatchStats`, `getWinRate`, `getCurrentRun`,
  `getReliabilityScore`, `getMostPlayedWith`, `getOpponentStats`,
  `getNemesis`, `getBestPartnership`, `getPlayerImpact`,
  `getPOTMVoteStats`) with zero callers. Pre-session-32 leftovers; the
  proper IO deeper-intel lives in `packages/core/engine/deeperIntel.js`
  now. Removing ~298 lines closes a latent RLS-blind-spot risk
  (every one used direct `.from()` reads). Commit: `9c17d4d`.

**Sweep verified clean:** post-fix, every direct `.from()` call left in
client code is either dead, demo-scoped, or hygiene-exempt. No more
RLS-blind-spot pathology in live customer read paths.

## RESOLVED (May 23 2026 — session 32)

- **B7: IO Intelligence deeper-intel cards were dead UI** — Most Played With (6+),
  Team Impact (7+), Nemesis (8+), Best Partnership (8+) all rendered the
  "Not enough data yet" placeholder in production, despite FEATURES.md
  marking them ✅ built. Root cause: `useIOIntelligence.js` hard-coded
  `mostPlayedWith`, `impact`, `nemesis`, `bestPartnership` to `null` and
  no upstream path computed them (RPC `get_team_state_by_player_token`
  returns only `match_stats`, `win_rate`, `reliability`;
  `computeStatsFromHistory` matched). Fixed by adding a pure client-side
  engine `packages/core/engine/deeperIntel.js` that computes all six
  deeper-intel metrics from `matches[]` + `squad[]` (already in state on
  every route). Wired into `computeStatsFromHistory` and both
  player-token state fetches in App.jsx. Hook stops nulling the keys.
  Shipped alongside two new cards (Most Faced Opponent 4+, Reliability
  Ranking 5+). Commit: `04877de`.

## RESOLVED (May 22 2026 — session 31)

- **B6: Status confirmation banners persisted on page refresh** — "🔒 Locked in",
  "👍 No worries we'll find cover" etc. all rendered on mount and only
  disappeared if the user happened to tap a status (firing the 5s timer).
  `hideConfirmation` initial value flipped from `false` to `true`; banners
  now only render in the 5s window after an actual `setStatus` call. Commit:
  `19abed9`.
- **B5: Player tile said "Are you in this Tuesday?" on a Wednesday match** —
  `gameDay` derived from `schedule.gameDateTime` first (which had drifted
  to a Tuesday in the demo schedule), falling back to `schedule.dayOfWeek`.
  Reversed the precedence: admin-configured `dayOfWeek` wins; the timestamp
  weekday is only a fallback. Commit: `c436992`.
- **B4: Smart Teams prediction stuck on "Even game" when one team is empty** —
  `computePrediction`'s `mean([]) ?? 0.5` defaulted both averages to 0.5,
  producing a draw verdict regardless of how lopsided the split was. Now
  returns `winner=null` when either side has 0 players; render guard hides
  the chip; confirm path saves NULL to `predicted_winner` rather than a
  misleading 'draw'. Commit: `d7cfa2f`.
- **B3: Manually-edited Smart Teams splits saved a stale prediction** — the
  algorithm's prediction was passed to `confirmTeams` even when the admin
  swapped players after Generate. Now the prediction is recomputed on every
  manual move (live), so the saved value always reflects the actual
  confirmed lineup. The "STALE / crossed-out" UI state was removed.
  Commit: `b31af19`.
- **B2: Game-is-live toggle blocked after Cancel This Week** — admin couldn't
  re-enable the game once cancelled. Root cause: `admin_upsert_schedule`
  writes day/kickoff/venue/etc but does NOT write `is_cancelled` or
  `active_match_id`. After `admin_cancel_match` set both, flipping
  `game_is_live=true` through the toggle left the schedule in conflicting
  state (`is_cancelled=true && game_is_live=true`, `active_match_id=null`)
  and the screen continued to render the cancelled state. New
  `admin_reopen_week` RPC (migration 032) owns the full reopen
  transaction: clears the cancelled state, inserts a fresh `matches`
  row, points `active_match_id` at it, writes a `week_reopened`
  audit_events row. JS `reopenWeek(adminToken)` wrapper. AdminView
  `openNextWeek` and ScheduleScreen `save` both branch through it when
  `schedule.isCancelled` is true. Verified against `team_demo`
  end-to-end via MCP. Commits: `5061508`, `e2f67ea`.

## RESOLVED (May 21 2026 — session 29)

- **B1: Stale `p.is_vice_captain` in 10 deployed RPCs** — `players.is_vice_captain` was
  removed in migration 026 (session 27) but 10 SECURITY DEFINER functions still referenced
  it in their SELECT clause. PL/pgSQL validates column references at runtime, not definition
  time, so all 10 failed silently with `internal_error`. Affected: all Manage Squad buttons
  (INJURED, DISABLE, PRIORITY), player attendance (`set_player_status`), payment marking
  (`set_player_paid`, `set_guest_payment`), injury self-report (`set_player_injured`),
  and admin tools (`admin_set_player_note`, `admin_set_player_status`,
  `admin_update_player_name`). Fixed via `apply_migration` — removed stale
  `'is_vice_captain', p.is_vice_captain,` line from all 10 SELECT clauses. Verified via
  `execute_sql` — all 10 return non-null. Schema cache reloaded. `admin_set_vice_captain`
  was already correct (uses `tp.is_vice_captain` via JOIN). No JS changes needed.
- **CreateTeam email field redundant** — `authUser` now flows App.jsx → Onboarding →
  `useOnboarding`, seeding `adminEmail` from OAuth email. Input field and validation
  removed from UI. RPC call unchanged. Commit: `419fba2`
- **"Make game live" hint** — Dismissible banner added to AdminView showing when
  `gameIsLive` is false and `ioo_game_live_hint_dismissed` not set. CTA links to
  Match Settings. Permanent dismiss via localStorage. Commit: `419fba2`

## RESOLVED (May 21 2026 — session 28)

- **ScoreScreen bib eligibility 401** — replaced `getBibEligiblePlayers` direct
  `player_match` read with synchronous derivation from `squad` prop (`bibsSorted`). No new
  RPC needed. `getBibEligiblePlayers` deleted from supabase.js. Commit: `8aaae57`
- **Admin Decide button** — confirmed non-bug. `POTMTiebreakModal` auto-detects
  `adminDecisionPending` on return to AdminView. Flow works correctly.
- **insertMatch 401** — App.jsx call site removed (`setMatchHistory` made pure);
  `insertMatch` deleted from `supabase.js`.
- **upsertSchedule dead import** — removed from App.jsx imports.
- **TeamsScreen hardcoded colours** — all 5 fixed with CSS variables.
- **App.jsx dead imports** — `insertMatch`, `upsertSchedule`, `addCoverPlayer`,
  `removeCoverPlayer`, `updateCoverPlayer`, `getUser`, `getUserProfile`,
  `getTeamByPlayerToken` all removed.
- **Raw RPC in AdminView/index.jsx** — `admin_confirm_payment` extracted to
  `confirmPayment()` wrapper in supabase.js.
- **Gold hardcoded colours in AdminView/index.jsx** — replaced with `var(--goldb)` / `var(--gold2)`.
- **console.warn in App.jsx** — changed to `console.error`.
- Dead functions removed from `supabase.js`: `bulkCancelLedgerEntries`,
  `bulkResetPlayerStatuses`, `deletePlayerMatchRows`, `findPlayerByUserId`,
  `findPlayersByName`, `getPlayerByUserId`, `updateCareerBibCount`, `insertBib`,
  `addCoverPlayer`, `removeCoverPlayer`, `updateCoverPlayer`, `getBibEligiblePlayers`
- Dead payment functions removed from `payments.js`: `handleClearDebt`, `handleStripePayment`
- `IsThisYou.jsx` deleted (never routed to or imported)
- Commits: `1784b44`, `3e2bfde`, `9003865`, `6df6fcf`, `9441888`, `957f63d`, `8aaae57`
